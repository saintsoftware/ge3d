Naming Conventiong Log

The 3 letter pre-fix is already adopted in most formats, adopting one for programing is not a big change.

The "_" allows to logic separete two words which is implicit for people to recognize those 2 words.

If a format uses less one or more one letter for redability reasons it not a problem to the naming convetion was long is build for redability...

---------------------------------

db_   :  Data Base

example : db_user = 'root'

 This already used in many places though the standard is 3 letters. It makes no logic to use another standard since people already created this standard.

---------------------

pjt_ : Project

example : pjt_title = 'GPL Segment Library'

---------------------

img_ : image

example : img_name = 'heander'

--------------------

png_ , jpg_ , gif_, bmp_

example : jpg_compression = 40

Image formats are straight foward unless some kind of conflit comes up...
