So now that we debating practical aspects about Logic compositions we can also debate on how to understand Q.I. What's 
wrong with today's capability to measure intellectual capability? 

What's wrong is that we measure just by one application of STG or GTS and we say a person is smart or not.

So let's put this in another way: let's say that Einstein scores 70 in STG and 70 In GTS while other people in is class
scored 90 in STG and 10 in GTS . So when people look at Einstein people may call him the donkey, since is under Q.I.
compared with all other members of is class. But when we add both of them Einstein end's up with 140 while others only
have 100 they are clear the less intellectual. So just because a person may look the donkey to you it does not necessary mean's
he is the donkey. It means some one is not adding both logic capabilities, since both belong to the same person and the
brain was refered before uses both compositions to handle life problems. Einstein understating of life is clear ahead
of is time and of other people. He can understand thing's in more different perspectives. As some say in math what matter 
is the end result and not the way that you get there. So if
Einstein is getting to the end result more times, is clear that he understand more then other people. Though for some people 
that are analyzing it may seems is understanding less because in a specific problem is doing less ... but the current test only 
handles things in one perspective ... so in reality Einstein is understanding much more because it can handle more perspectives...

Not saying that some people are not intellectually limited, the problem is that is much harder to understand how much people
are really smart, just because a person is not being smart at this moment, or can't handle one type of problem it does not
mean is not the smartest person on the room.

This problem may lead to severe ego problems and self estimate problems, some people report that Einstein behave
a bit strange, having some kid of exhibitionism behavior, this is obvious a reflex of people that judge I'm in past. It 
need to have this behavior to tell to people do you see I'm not the donkey that you people say i am. Actually i'm much 
smarter then you people, but i can't explain this to you people because you will not understand it. I was not there, but
I'm pretty sure that this may be, what he was thinking when he have it's problem on school and abandon ending up not 
finishing it...

How do i know that Einstein was 70/70, well i saw a documentary on Albert life and he develop the theory for
the first fridge he apply the theory and build it. So it not only have theoretical capability was he can apply what he knows.

Let's analyze my case and a friend of mine. I have in a scale from 0 to 20 around 8 in math, and my friend have 20, so
every one says that he is a really smart person. So who do you think will perform best in a life test? The guy that have 8
in math or the guy who have 20?

We both study Permaculture, which is the application of ecologic natural system, since is something that depends highly on the
amount of resources available and materials the theory doesn't do that much for you because it have no implicit method 
you have to develop one by your self. I understand how things worked analyze the resources available and develop several
new methods and apply them more or less successfully. My friend since is so
dependent on the theory he didn't develop any thing and could not apply any of he's theory's. He believed that need more 
study... 

So now we come back to our initial question after the field trip who is
the most smart person? Who have a better understanding of what he knows or who attempt to apply excessive theory? Who will
survive in a real life scenario?

It's much better to develop a simple solution and apply it then not develop any solution at all which means you are to 
attach to something. This explains what happen in those people in Einstein class sure they could have great grades, but
that does not mean they could apply more then Einstein in a real life problems.

A proper intellectual test have to include the different concepts use in STG and GTS. Management for example how well a 
person administrate is money, does it is used in adequate with the social need's and environment. Another thing that the
test most include is to handle problem solving. Traditionally people only think that math problem solving is what 
determinate all the person capability. So this is a typical example of an autist, it may have a very large capability to 
handle languages was this guy i saw in a documentary that handle 26 languages but it was unable to go to the supermarket
by it self. It's clear he have only problem solving capability and have no management capability. He could score for
example in STG 120 and GTS 5 so it only end up with 125. So is not that smart though he have a extraordinary capability.So 
no one can beat him, because most people do not pass for example 90 in STG he clears beat by 30 points most people, so
when we add those people point 70 with 30 we and up with 110, so this autist is not that far ahead, though impressive but
not that far ahead. If now we add Einstein 140 clear that Einstein in some situations may look like the less impressive
person in the room but is the most smart. Though that will be hard to determinate that using current standards.

So if you add the management for example of money with the capability to solve problems then you may get close to the 
person real QI. For example Bill Gates though some people may think is not that smart. He scores great in management
capabilities i saw a documentary on he's life and before of Microsoft was created he already was a great manager. So it may 
not develop the next relativity theory but pretty sure that in this new test he will score much higher them most people
think he will score.

In a way GTS and STG deals with to abilities in our life, your practical skills how much are you applying and at your theory
skills how much can you understand before you apply something. You can understand a great deal of things before you 
apply but does not mean you are great in applying them. Because it need a different set of skills to apply something in
a real life situation.

I'm of the opinion that children should go out in to the fields and pratice their skills in permaculture, if they stay all
day inside the room attempting to develop their theorical skills, they end up like my friend, they have a great theory 
skill but in real life they can't applay them because they din't develop that type of skill.
