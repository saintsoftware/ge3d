Actualy at some point i writte that the intention is to do code refactor, but for me i don't have much knowledge in C and probably many 
other people. Doing code refactor requires extensive knowledge, it was not a well thought conclusion. The thing that is more realistic to do is to follow tutorials on the tasks to learn more. That was the point of the engine that people can learn from the tasks with tutorials.  

So added TCP_client and TCP_server which is a topic that may be of interested for some people, since it is used on a lot of places, probably more interesting then developing the image library.

Adding several tasks may help out people that just want to learn one or two topics and not learn all the engine specifications, because a lot of this stuff can become a bit specific them most people would like so or have to time to learn that deep in to specifications.

For those that do not wish to develop code for engine, it is still a good place to find information. Well documentation can serve to us all...
