GE3D Game Engine

This project attempts to developed a set of C libraries that are structured using Segmentation a application of GTS logic composition. 

A code structure concept develop by my self after studying logic for some years and implemented it on a small scale in web pages.

The concepts for understanding Segmentation can be found at: tutorials it need a bit re-writting but the information is there. Not that good with
English...

The project is released under the GPL3 License.

One of the goals of the engine is to produce better code structure also to aid others in the process of learning. So it kind is a bit of evolving 
project... Instead of a Engine since it is very low level it could be converted also in a library structure that can also work to develop applications.

It is possible to reach that stage, but my initial objectives is to keep it simple only make it usable for the necessary stuff... This is largely due to the
fact that i never worked in C, so comming from another language to attempt to implement Segmentation in C it's a challange... To where this
challange will take me i have no clue...
